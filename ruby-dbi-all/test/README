Ruby DBI Test Configuration
======================================================================

In order to run the "testdbi.rb" test suite, you must define a
configuration file for your environment.  The configuration file
should end with ".cfg" and define the following parameters.

driver drivername        -- Name of the DBI driver (e.g. Pg)
dbname dbname            -- Name of the database to use for testing
user username            -- User name for database
password pw              -- Password for user (may be blank)
table names              -- Name of table to fill with names for testing
setup setup_script       -- Name of a script to initialize the DB
teardown teardown_script -- Name of a script to cleanup the DB
                            after testing

The testdbi.rb program will run the unit tests once for each config
file it finds in the current directory.

The directory example contains an example configuration file and
setup/teardown scripts.  Copy the example.cfg to the current directory
and edit appropriately.  Modify the setup/teardown scripts as needed.
