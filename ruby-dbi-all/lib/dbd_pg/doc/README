Ruby DBI PostgreSql Driver  version 
=========================================

This is an implementation of the ruby-dbi driver for the PostgreSql
data base.  It is designed to be used with Rainer Perl's Ruby DBI
implementation.  It is built upon Noboru Saitou's basic Postgres
package.

Warning: This software is very experimental.  The ruby DBI interface
is still a moving target.

See the following URL's for required software ...

Noboru Saitou's Postgres Package:

Installation
============

    Install like every DBD.

Unit Tests
==========

There are unit tests available, but currently they depend on a
pre-existing database on my machine.  Future versions will remove that
dependency.  To run the tests, type "make test".
