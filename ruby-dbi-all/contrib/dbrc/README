DBRC

What is it?

   A supplement to the dbi module, allowing you to avoid hard-coding
   passwords in your programs that make database connections.

What does it do?

   It reads entries out of a file called .dbrc, which is meant to be
   analogous to the .netrc file (used by programs such as telnet).

   The .dbrc file is simply a space separated list of items that
   contain the following:

   Database name
   User name
   Password
   Driver
   Timeout (for connections)
   Maximum number of reconnect attempts (for retry blocks)
   Interval (seconds between connection attempts)

What's the point?

   The point is to provide a bit of obfuscation for passwords and a
   bit of convenience, by  having all of your database entries in
   one place.

Isn't that dangerous?

   The rules for the .dbrc file state that it must have perms of
   600 and be owned by uid of the script that calls it.  That
   means that only *you* and *root* should be able to see it.

What it doesn't do:

   It does not establish a database connection.  It's simply meant
   to provide information.
